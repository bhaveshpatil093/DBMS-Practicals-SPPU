# Greedy Search Algorithm
## Detailed Explanation

## What is Greedy Search?

Greedy Search (also called Greedy Best-First Search) is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to guide its search toward the goal. At each step, it expands the node that appears to be closest to the goal, based on the heuristic estimate.

Key Principle: Make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping to find a global optimum.

## Heuristic Function

A heuristic function h(n) estimates the cost from node n to the goal.

Properties:
- h(goal) = 0 (at goal, distance is zero)
- h(n) ≥ 0 for all nodes
- Should be easy to compute
- Guides search toward promising directions

Common heuristics:
- Straight-line distance (Euclidean distance)
- Manhattan distance (grid-based problems)
- Number of misplaced tiles (puzzle problems)

## How Greedy Search Works

### Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize: Start with the initial node in the open list (priority queue)
2. Select: Choose node with **minimum heuristic value** h(n)
3. Goal Check: If the current node is a goal, return the path
4. Expand: Generate all neighbors of the current node
5. Evaluate: Calculate heuristic for each neighbor
6. Add to Queue: Insert neighbors into priority queue by h(n)
7. Repeat: Go to step 2 until the goal is found or the queue is empty

### Pseudocode

```
Function GREEDY_SEARCH(start, goal):
    open_list = priority_queue()
    open_list.add(start, h(start))
    visited = set()
    
    WHILE open_list is not empty:
        current = open_list.pop_min()  // Node with min h(n)
        
        IF current == goal:
            RETURN path
        
        IF current in visited:
            CONTINUE
        
        visited.add(current)
        
        FOR each neighbor of current:
            IF neighbor not in visited:
                open_list.add(neighbor, h(neighbor))
    
    RETURN failure
```

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Informed Search
- Uses domain knowledge (heuristic)
- More efficient than blind search (BFS, DFS)
- Guided toward a goal

### 2. Greedy Selection
- Always picks the node with the best (lowest) heuristic
- May ignore actual path cost
- Focus on "promising" nodes

### 3. Not Optimal
- Does NOT guarantee the shortest path
- Can get trapped by misleading heuristics
- Path cost is not considered, only heuristic

### 4. Not Complete
- May fail to find a solution if stuck in a dead end
- Can enter infinite loops in graphs with cycles
- Complete only in finite spaces with cycle detection

## Example Walkthrough

### Graph Setup
```
       A (h=7)
      / \
     B   C (h=4)
    (h=6)\
    / \   F (h=1)
   D   E   \
  (h=3)(h=3) G (goal, h=0)
```

### Execution Steps

**Step 1**: Start at A (h=7)
- Open list: [A]
- Expand A → Add B(h=6), C(h=4)

**Step 2**: Select C (lowest h=4)
- Open list: [B(h=6), C(h=4)]
- Expand C → Add F(h=1)

**Step 3**: Select F (lowest h=1)
- Open list: [B(h=6), F(h=1)]
- Expand F → Add G(h=0)

**Step 4**: Select G (h=0)
- Goal reached!
- Path: A → C → F → G

Note: Greedy chose path based on heuristic, not actual cost. Path A→B→D→G might be shorter in actual distance, but greedy doesn't check.

## Comparison with Other Algorithms

| Algorithm | Uses Heuristic? | Considers Path Cost? | Optimal? | Complete? |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| BFS | No | Yes (uniform) | Yes* | Yes |
| DFS | No | No | No | No |
| Greedy | Yes | No | No | No** |
| A* | Yes | Yes | Yes*** | Yes |

\* Optimal for unweighted graphs  
\*\* Complete with cycle detection  
\*\*\* When heuristic is admissible

## Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(b^m)
- b = branching factor
- m = maximum depth
- Worst case explores the entire tree

Space Complexity: O(b^m)
- Must store all generated nodes in memory
- Priority queue grows exponentially

In Practice: Much better than the worst case when the heuristic is good

---

## Advantages

1. Fast: Often finds solutions quickly with good heuristics
2. Simple: Easy to implement and understand
3. Memory Efficient**: Compared to A*, stores less information
4. Guided: More efficient than uninformed search
5. Flexible: Works with any heuristic function

---

## Disadvantages

1. Not Optimal: May find suboptimal paths
2. Can Get Stuck: Misleading heuristics cause poor performance
3. Not Complete: May fail in infinite spaces
4. Ignores Cost: Only looks at heuristic, not actual path cost
5. Heuristic Dependent: Performance varies greatly with heuristic quality

---

## When to Use Greedy Search

### Good For:
- Problems where solution speed > solution quality
- Good heuristic available
- Finding "good enough" solutions quickly
- Resource-constrained environments

### Not Good For:
- Finding optimal solutions
- Problems with misleading heuristics
- Safety-critical applications
- When path cost matters

## Real-World Applications

1. Route Finding: GPS navigation (quick routes)
2. Puzzle Solving: 8-puzzle, Rubik's cube (fast solutions)
3. Robot Path Planning: Quick obstacle avoidance
4. Game AI: Move selection in games
5. Network Routing: Fast packet routing
6. Resource Allocation: Quick scheduling decisions

## Example: Romania Map Problem

Problem: Travel from Arad to Bucharest

Heuristic: Straight-line distance to Bucharest

Greedy Path: 
- Arad (h=366) → Sibiu (h=253) → Fagaras (h=176) → Bucharest (h=0)
- Total cost: 140 + 99 + 211 = **450 km**

Optimal Path:
- Arad → Sibiu → Rimnicu → Pitesti → Bucharest
- Total cost: 418 km

Greedy found a solution 32 km longer than optimal because it was "greedy" and only looked at the heuristic, not the actual distance.

## Improving Greedy Search

### 1. Better Heuristics
- More accurate estimates
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Learned heuristics

### 2. Use A* Instead
- Considers both h(n) and g(n)
- f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
- Guarantees an optimal solution

### 3. Add Randomization
- Randomly choose among good options
- Avoid getting stuck
- Better exploration

## Implementation Tips

1. Use Priority Queue: For efficient min extraction (heapq in Python)
2. Track Visited: Avoid revisiting nodes
3. Store Path: Keep track of how we reached each node
4. Handle Ties: Define a tie-breaking rule when h(n) values are equal
5. Validate Heuristic: Ensure h(n) is admissible for domain

---

## Key Formulas

Selection Criterion: 
```
Select node n where h(n) is minimum
```

Heuristic Function:
```
h(n) = estimated cost from n to goal
```

Path Cost (not used by greedy):
```
g(n) = actual cost from start to n
```

## Conclusion

Greedy Search is a fast, heuristic-driven algorithm that makes locally optimal choices. While it doesn't guarantee the best solution, it's valuable when:
- Speed matters more than optimality
- A good heuristic is available
- "Good enough" solution is acceptable

For optimal solutions, consider A* algorithm, which combines greedy's heuristic guidance with actual path cost consideration.
